        Skill India is an initiative of the Government of India which has been launched to empower the youth of the country with skill sets which make them more employable and more productive in their work environment. Our National Skill Mission is chaired by the honorable Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi himself. India is a country today with 65% of its youth in the working age group. If ever there is a way to reap this demographic advantage, it has to be through skill development of the youth so that they add not only to their personal growth, but to the countryâ€™s economic growth as well. Skill Development Center, VS University offers courses across 20 different sectors in the District which are aligned to the standards recognized by both, the industry and the government.. The courses help a person focus on practical delivery of work and help him enhance his technical expertise so that he is ready for day one of his job and companies do not have to invest into training him for his job profile.
